      <description>&amp;ldquo;SSH login got slower, be happy!&amp;rdquo; a.k.a.: a quantum slower against quantum attacks We regularly gather all kind of metrics to ensure Ubuntu is/stays/gets (depends on your POV) great. One of the metrics that I wanted to look at for way too long, but the change was too small to do so earlier was our check on non interactive ssh login speed.
In that test we check how quickly you can log into ssh, do nothing and return which was a lessons learned from a bug years ago that it is better to watch for.</description>
