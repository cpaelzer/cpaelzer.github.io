      <description>Better smoking on a gas grill a.k.a I want moaaarrr smoke I started smoking on the gas grill and wanted to evaluate how much (or not) I&amp;rsquo;d need either a real smoker of some sort or if smoking on the gas grill was sufficient for me. As most gas-grill-smoker efforts do I started with a smoke pipe and it worked.
But it either gave me a bit of smoke for 30-45 minutes or somewhat more smoke for maybe 10 minutes to then be burned out.</description>
